      <p>Download Instructions: Wait for the file to finish downloading. In Google Chrome, click on the small arrow next to the file name, and then click Show In Folder. Then (for windows), right-clik on the folder, the click Extract All. Next, click Extract. Then, you should see another window open. Double-click on the file named "Down.exe". Maybe, Winodws will open some window saying that they protected you. Click on More Info, then a button should appear at the bottom sayng Run anyway. Click that. Please trust me. I am not trying to hurt you. It should open your game. After you are done, press the Windows icon key on your keyboard, or press Alt+tab. Then, right click on the Unity icon on your taskbar and click Close Window.</p>
